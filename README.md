## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the initial step in designing a website or application.  
Think of it as a **blueprint** — it shows the structure, layout, and flow of a product without focusing on colors, fonts, or visuals. Its purpose is to map out how users will interact with the interface.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
- **Clarifies ideas** – Turns abstract concepts into a clear structure.  
- **Improves communication** – Helps teams, clients, and developers stay aligned.  
- **Finds issues early** – Detects navigation or usability problems before development.  
- **Saves time & cost** – Easier to fix mistakes at the wireframe stage.  
- **Guides design & development** – Acts as a reference for creating the final product.  

## Types of Wireframes
- **Low-fidelity**: Simple sketches or rough layouts focusing on structure.  
- **High-fidelity**: Detailed versions, closer to the final design with refined elements.  

## Tools
There are many tools for wireframing, but **Figma** is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly options for creating both wireframes and prototypes.
