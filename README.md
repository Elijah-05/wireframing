# wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the initial step in designing a website or application.  
Think of it as a **blueprint** — it shows the structure, layout, and flow of a product without focusing on colors, fonts, or visuals. Its purpose is to map out how users will interact with the interface.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
- **Clarifies ideas** – Turns abstract concepts into a clear structure.  
- **Improves communication** – Helps teams, clients, and developers stay aligned.  
- **Finds issues early** – Detects navigation or usability problems before development.  
- **Saves time & cost** – Easier to fix mistakes at the wireframe stage.  
- **Guides design & development** – Acts as a reference for creating the final product.  

## Types of Wireframes
- **Low-fidelity**: Simple sketches or rough layouts focusing on structure.  
- **High-fidelity**: Detailed versions, closer to the final design with refined elements.  

## Tools
There are many tools for wireframing, but **Figma** is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly options for creating both wireframes and prototypes.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
Wireframes are built around a few essential elements that define the user experience:

### 1. Layout Structure
Defines how different sections are arranged on a page.  
*Example:* A homepage might have a **header at the top, content in the middle, and a footer at the bottom**.

### 2. Navigation
Shows how users move between pages or sections.  
*Example:* A **navigation bar** with links like *Home, About, Contact* ensures users can find information easily.

### 3. Content Placement
Indicates where text, images, and media will appear.  
*Example:* A **blog post wireframe** might show the title at the top, an image below it, and text content underneath.

### 4. Functionality
Represents interactive parts of the interface.  
*Example:* A **login wireframe** could include input boxes for *username* and *password* along with a *Login button*.

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose:** Rough sketches or simple digital layouts.  
- **Focus:** Structure, layout, and overall flow without much detail.  
- **When used:** In the early stages of design to brainstorm and validate ideas quickly.  

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose:** Detailed and polished representations of the final design.  
- **Focus:** Specific layouts, typography, spacing, and sometimes clickable interactions.  
- **When used:** Later in the design process, when the concept is finalized and ready to hand off to developers.  

## Example Wireframe
You can view a sample wireframe [here](#) (replace `#` with your Figma link).  

This is a **High-Fidelity Wireframe** of a booking platform.  
It includes refined details like layout precision, typography, and interactive elements — making it very close to how the final product will look.
